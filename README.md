# SAGeV_API

SAGeV (South African Gender Violence) API is a prototype for the Microsoft Safe@Home Hackathon to challenge gender based violence in South Africa. 

It aims to create a live database from affected people to allow NGOs and goverment organisation to use more up to date to focus resources more accurately on those in need and to highlight problem areas in realtime across the country.
